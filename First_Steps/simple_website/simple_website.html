<h3>Just Another Day</h3>
<p>Written by Christina on January 11th</p>
</header>

<p>This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you.
     I published my first article about business blogging in August, 2001.
      You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then,
       including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.

      water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.
